We are a group of geneticists and computational biologists trying to understand how gene expression regulation by genetic variants modulates risk to cancer and the evolution of tumours. 
We are integrated in <a href="https://www.ualg.pt/centro-de-investigacao-em-tecnologias-e-servicos-de-saude"> CINTESIS-UAlg </a> and are located on the 3rd floor of Building 8 in the Gambelas Campus of the University of Algarve. We are easily accessible by car or by bus from downtown Faro. We are also 5 minutes away from Faro International Airport and the beach!
