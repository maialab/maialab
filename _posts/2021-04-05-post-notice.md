We have just added two manuscripts to bioRχiv.

1. **Expression of *PIK3CA* mutations is prognostic in breast cancer** We have found an association of *PIK3CA*'s mutant allele expression imbalance with breast cancer prognosis - doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.05.434137


2. **quincunx, an novel R package providing the first client interface to the PGS Catalog REST API**. quincunx enables users to query and quickly retrieve, filter and integrate metadata associated with polygenic scores, as well as polygenic scoring files in tidy table format.
